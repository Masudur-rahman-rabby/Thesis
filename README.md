Eye-Controlled Automated Wheelchair enables users to navigate a wheelchair using eye movements and blinks. Using a Raspberry Pi for real-time processing, the system tracks eye gaze and detects blinks to control movement. Featuring precise eye-tracking algorithms, it ensures accurate and responsive mobility for disabled individuals, providing a hands-free and accessible navigation solution.
