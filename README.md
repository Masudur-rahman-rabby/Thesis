# Thesis: IoT-Enabled and Head-Gesture Controlled Wheelchair Navigation

IoT-Enabled and Head-Gesture Controlled Wheelchair Navigation empowers users to operate a wheelchair through intuitive head movements. The system employs motion sensors and a microcontroller for real-time gesture recognition, while IoT integration enables remote monitoring and data exchange. Compared to joystick and voice control approaches, it delivers greater precision, adaptability, and user comfort, offering an accessible and reliable mobility solution for individuals with disabilities.
